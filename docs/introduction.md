# Introduction

Joule is a Jekyll utility helper designed to make it (way) easier to write unit tests.

So far, Joule has only been tested with [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest). However, you **should** be able to use it with other testing frameworks.

There is a _slight_ bit of setup required to get Jekyll setup for testing.

Check out our **[Setup](/setup.md)** documentation to get started!
